Welcome to the "Histogram with simulated random variables" app, that was developed for the Developing Data Products Course, from Coursera. This app helps you understand the concepts of random variable and how it behaves in terms of standard deviations, mean, lambda etc. 


First, below are the parameters you can choose:
1) The data distribution type: Normal or Exponential.
2) Sample Size: Between 100 to 5000 in steps of 100
3a) For Normal Distribution, input the mean and Standard Deviation
3b) for Exponential, input the lambda

The histogram is drawn as per the parameters inputted, and it will re-adjusts automatically whenever there is any change in the input paramters entered/selected.

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on the xxxxxx
